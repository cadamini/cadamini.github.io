## Contribution guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my project. Any contribution is helpful.

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem and no related issue exist, [open a new issue](https://github.com/cadamini/cadamini.github.io/issues/new). 

Minor issues, such as typos, can be fixed without a pull request.

### Solve an issue

Check out [existing issues]([https://github.com/cadamini.github.io/issues](https://github.com/cadamini/cadamini.github.io/issues)). If you find an issue to work on, feel free to open a pull request to fix it.

### Local changes and preview

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!
3. You can preview your changes locally by running a Jekyll server with `jekyll server`.
4. Commit the changes once you are happy.
5. When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.  
    If applicable, include the related issue url.

I try to review issues and merge pull requests as soon as possible beside my normal job.  
Before I merge a pull request, I may suggest changes or add pull request comments.
